<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Trying again, does it save?
=======
Within the desktop, I just right clicked and said open in R studio. It did open, in Project: (None). 
Then I saved it. Did it update?
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

At 5:46, i opened this rmd file from the actual windows folder, wrote this sentence and saved it. 

At 5:51, I did 'edit in place" in the actual Github website, there's a button at the top to commit changes.
